When you were a young kid, did you get to go to a video store and browse the
shelves holding all of those movies?  Do you miss the days when you could
'feel' the boxes, the VHS tapes, even the actual discs of the DVDs and Blu-Ray?

Here at The Tactile Cinephile, we are honoring the past by cataloguing an
inventory of playable physical media in the form of Blu-Rays, DVDs and even VHS
tapes. You can add to the collection, search the whole catalog, or list
everything there is!
